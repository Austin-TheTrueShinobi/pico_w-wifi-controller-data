# Project for utilizing communication protocols on the Pico-W

**Project Description:**

The **pico_w-wifi-controller-data** project comprises three main components: Bluetooth, TCP, and UDP functionalities. The Bluetooth directory contains GATT (Generic Attribute Profile) Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) support for **Pico_W**, including implementations and examples related to Bluetooth communication. The TCP directory includes implementations for TCP server communication with **Pico_W**, providing relevant code and examples. The UDP directory contains code for UDP communication, allowing users to modify the broadcaster address to send UDP packets to specific destinations, such as a **Raspberry Pi 4**.

**Usage Instructions:**

- **Bluetooth:** Users can find implementations and examples related to Bluetooth communication in the Bluetooth directory.
- **TCP:** Instructions on setting up and using TCP server functionalities are available in the TCP directory.
- **UDP:** Users can modify the broadcaster address and utilize UDP functionalities in the UDP directory.

**Miscellaneous Files:**

- **CMake:** CMake is used in this project to manage the build process for the Bluetooth, TCP, and UDP directories. It is a versatile tool designed for building, testing, and packaging software, simplifying the specification of build parameters and dependencies.
- **Makefile:** This Makefile serves as a script for building and compiling the project. It contains rules and dependencies describing how the project should be built, automating the compilation process and eliminating the need for complex build commands.

**Directory Structure:**

```makefile
BLUETOOTH_DIR = Bluetooth
TCP_DIR = TCP
UDP_DIR = UDP
```

**Targets:**

```makefile
all: bluetooth tcp udp

bluetooth:
	@echo "Building Bluetooth components..."
	@$(MAKE) -C $(BLUETOOTH_DIR)

tcp:
	@echo "Building TCP components..."
	@$(MAKE) -C $(TCP_DIR)

udp:
	@echo "Building UDP components..."
	@$(MAKE) -C $(UDP_DIR)

clean:
	@echo "Cleaning Bluetooth components..."
	@$(MAKE) clean -C $(BLUETOOTH_DIR)
	@echo "Cleaning TCP components..."
	@$(MAKE) clean -C $(TCP_DIR)
	@echo "Cleaning UDP components..."
	@$(MAKE) clean -C $(UDP_DIR)
```

**Usage Instructions:**

The `help` target provides a summary of available make commands and their usage.

```makefile
.PHONY: help
help:
	@echo "Usage: make [target]"
	@echo "Targets:"
	@echo "  all        - Build Bluetooth, TCP, and UDP components"
	@echo "  bluetooth  - Build Bluetooth components"
	@echo "  tcp        - Build TCP components"
	@echo "  udp        - Build UDP components"
	@echo "  clean      - Clean built components"
```

**Additional Notes:**

- You can dynamically grab the first available IPV4 using: `ip4addr_ntoa(netif_ip4_addr(netif_list)), TCP_PORT)`
- Controller wireless access command: `cmake -DPICO_BOARD=pico_w -DWIFI_SSID="RPcontroller" -DWIFI_PASSWORD="RPcontroller" ..`
